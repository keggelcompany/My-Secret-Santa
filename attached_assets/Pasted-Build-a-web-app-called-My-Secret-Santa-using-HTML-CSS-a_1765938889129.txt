Build a web app called "My Secret Santa" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a premium platform for organizing Secret Santa gift exchanges for companies, friends, or family groups. Features include automatic participant matching, personalized "Wrapped" summaries, downloadable cards, wishlists, and gift management.
Use these design guidelines:

Primary colors: Accent red #D83F31, secondary green #1F4C34.
Secondary colors: #D3AF64 (gold), #FFFFFF (white), and dark backgrounds like #000000 or similar for contrast.
Font: Futura for headings and main text; fallback to sans-serif. Use bold variants like Futura Heavy PT for titles.
Overall style: Elegant, holiday-themed with Christmas elements like snow globes, candy canes, and subtle festive animations (e.g., light snow effect if possible).
Incorporate the Figma design for the hero section: Import or replicate the hero from my connected Figma file (node-id=1-70 in the HolidayChallenge prototype). It includes a green background hero with "Santa Claus is coming to town!" text in white/red, a snow globe image with a Christmas tree and Santa hat, a "Reaching" subtitle, and a "My Secret Santa" logo. Below it, show buttons like "Find Gifts" in red rounded style and "Wishlist" in gold.

App structure:

Home page: Simple layout with the hero section at the top. Below it, a section explaining how it works (steps: 1. Create event as host, 2. Add participants via email, 3. Automatic matching, 4. Manage wishlists and gifts, 5. Event wrap-up with personalized cards). Then an FAQ section with accordion-style questions (e.g., "What is Secret Santa?", "How does matching work?", "Is it free?"). End with a CTA button: "PLAY NOW" or "Crear tu primer intercambio" in red, leading to the new exchange creation.
Authentication: Simple email-based login/signup. No passwords; use magic links sent via email for simplicity (simulate email sending in console or use a placeholder API).
User roles:
Host: Also a participant, can admin the event (view all matches, end event).
Participant: Invited via email, can accept invite, create wishlist, view their assigned Santa match (the person they gift to).

New Exchange flow (after clicking PLAY NOW):
Form for host: Event name, host name, host email.
Add participants: Dynamic form to add multiple guests with name + email fields. Button to send invites (simulate sending emails that include a join link).
Once set up, generate unique event ID and perform random matching (ensure no self-matches, use JS to shuffle assignments).

Participant dashboard (after accepting invite):
Create/edit wishlist: List of items with add/remove, perhaps with gift ideas or links.
View Santa match: Reveal the person they are gifting to (e.g., "Your Secret Santa target is [Name]").
After event ends (host triggers): Generate and share a personalized "Wrapped" card – a downloadable image/PDF summarizing the event (e.g., "You gifted to [Name]", fun stats like total gifts, holiday theme). Use canvas or a library for generation.

Backend: Use Replit's built-in database (like Repl DB) to store events, users, matches, wishlists. Handle CRUD operations with JS.
Make it responsive for mobile/desktop. Add subtle animations for buttons and reveals.
